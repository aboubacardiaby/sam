                        <p>&nbsp;The challenges continue to be the motivation of 
			  people and seeking to make our members aware that this 
			  organization is essential to our community and that we need the 
			  support of our fellow members in order for this to propel forward. </p>
			  <p>&nbsp;I believe that we have a great executive team who is 
			  dedicated to this organization. We want to know who you are and 
			  get to know you a little more. Let us know what&#8217;s going on with 
			  you, new jobs, graduations, weddings, baptisms, talents&#8230; are you 
			  new to Minnesota, what&#8217;s going well for you here and what are your 
			  obstacles. Let us celebrate together and support each other in 
			  times of needs. Be active in the organization, attend functions, 
			  and give us suggestions and feedback.</p>
			  <p align="left" class="style9">Our Senegalese community is 
			  expanding, and we must become stronger. Our children are growing, 
			  and maturing in a society outside of their culture. They need to 
			  see and live their culture, so let us serve as role models to them 
			  by showing them how to be part of a community. I want to thank the 
			  past and current Executive Committee for all the hard work that 
			  they have and continue to put into this association. I would also 
			  like to thank our members who contribute and participate for their 
			  support. </p>
			  <p align="left" class="style9">On the same token, I would like to 
			  encourage those who have not participated yet to get involved, so 
			  that we may all enjoy this association and benefit from its 
			  greater purpose. </p>
			  <p align="left" class="style9">I look forward to a prosperous year 
			  with the new executive committee and welcome each and every 
			  community member to integrate themselves with SAM so that we may 
			  become a better, livelier community.</p>
			  <p class="auto-style2">Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			  <strong>The President</strong></p>
